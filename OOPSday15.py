# Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming approach are
#  buit using object that represent real world entites, 
# and these objects contain data(attributes) and behaviour(methods)

# every object has:
# Data (properties/variable)
# work (Functions/methods)

# 4 Pillers of OOPS:
# 1) Encapsulation
# 2) Inheritance
# 3) Polymorphism
# 4) Abstraction

# Importance Of OOPS:
# Large Project
# Team Work 
# Code Reuse 
# Easy to maintan

# Class:
# A class is a blueprint or template used to create object. It defines the 
# properties(Variables) and behaviors(methods) that an object will have

# Class ek naksha(Map/Blueprint) hai jiske base ham objects banate hai

# Real life example
# House(Class)
# Room
# Color
# Washroom

# Houses(objects)
# Kunali ka ghar
# Shruti ka ghar
# Sarthak Ka ghar


# Example/Syntax:
# created class here
class Student():
    name = "Kunali"
    age = 20

# Explanation:
# class --> Keyword 
# Student --> Class Name
# name,age --> attributes


# Creating object from the class

# s1 = Student()
# print(s1.age)
# print(s1.name)

# Explanationss:
# s1--> object
# Student() --> is class ka object banaya
# . --> Object ke data ko access karna / adreess or referance FloatingPoint

# note: class name should be start with CAPITAL 
# Letter and the name should be meaningfull
