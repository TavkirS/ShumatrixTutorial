# What is python
# Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn, powerful programming language used for web development, automation, data science, AI, and more.
# ===============================

# Print Statement
# print("Helloo World")

# ===============================

#  Variables
# -----------
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

name = "Sarthak" 

# ===============================

# Naming Rules for Python variables
# -------------------------
# myname
# my_nam
# myName => camel case
# MyName1 => pascal case
# my_name_one  => snake 

# ===============================

# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# ---------------------------------
# name1, name2, name3 = "Kunali", "Sarthak" , "Taukir"
# print(name1)
# name1, name2, name3 = "Sarthak", "Rajesh" , "Taukir"
# # name1 = name2 = name3 = "Sarthak"
# print(name1)

# ===============================

# One Value to Multiple Variables
# ---------------------------------
# x = y = z = "Orange"
# print(x)

# ===============================

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
# (+ , ",")

# name = "Sarthak"
# age = "is"
# roll = "Engg"

# print(name,age,roll)
# print(name+age+roll)

# ===============================

# Global Variable
# ---------------
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

# x= "Sarthak is awsome"

# def myfun():
#     global x
#     x="Kunali is awsome"

# myfun()
# print(x)
# print(x) 

# We canot give a name to variable which alredy built in python
